                <h4>Wondering what category of spellcaster you are? Then look no further!</h2>
                <br>
                <p>There are many differentt types of casters in dungeons and dragons. You have full spellcasters, such as wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, druids, clerics, and bards.</p>
                <p>The half casters are paladins, rangers, and artificers.</p>
                <p>Then there are the third casters, which so far are only subclasses like eldritch knight fighters and arcane trickster rogues.</p>
            </div>
            <br>

            <div class="column">
                <h2>Full Casters:</h2>
                <p>These spellcasters are labeled full casters because they all get spell slots up to 9th level, 
                    and all gain cantrips as they level up.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Bards</h3>
                <h3>Clerics</h3>
                <h3>Druids</h3>
                <h3>Sorcerers</h3>
                <h3>Warlocks</h3>
                <h3>Wizards</h3>

                <h2>Half Casters:</h2>
                <p>Half casters are an interesting bunch, as their spells slots only reach the 5th level,
                    and they gain their spells at half the rate of full casters.
                    Oddly enough, only one half caster class gets cantrips, and those are artificers.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Artificers</h3>
                <h3>Paladins</h3>
                <h3>Rangers</h3>

                <h2>Third Casters:</h2>
                <p>Simply put, third casters are an even more diluted form of half casters, 
                    as they don't learn cantrips, 
                    their spell slots only go to the 3rd level, 
                    and gain spell slots at a third of the full casters' rate.</p>
